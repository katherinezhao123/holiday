                <p class="pb-0"> January was a time of wildfires and WW3 threats. Febuaray was the begining of COVID 19, and a time for growing fear. March through well,December, really, was the time of stocking up on toliet paper. And now, here we are, at the last few weeks of this infinity-like year. So- what should you be proud of?

                  When you feel overwhelmed, and have the time to, which I know can't be that often, try to just sit back and relax. In this year of craziness, I like to think that one positive was that I grew closer to my family- maybe you got to spend more time with yours? And while we all would love for
                  things to get back to normal, that might not happen for a little more. The best we can do is just enjoy the little pleasures that we currently have.

                And while I can't completely relate to what you're going through (I'm a student), that feeling of loneliness and longing for normality is there for me too. This holiday season may be exhausting, but one thing's for sure. Your kids, and everyone around you don't expect anything more than to just spend time with you.
              So have a wonderful holiday season, and hopefully, sooner rather than later, we can all get back to some degree of normality.    </p>
